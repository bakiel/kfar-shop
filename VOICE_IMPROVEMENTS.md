# Voice Chat Improvements

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Overlapping Voices Issue
- Created `useAudioQueue` hook to manage audio playback sequentially
- Implements a queue system that plays one audio at a time
- Stops all audio when user starts speaking
- Prevents multiple voices from playing simultaneously
- Added priority system for urgent messages

### 2. Added KFAR Logo to Voice Popup
- Added KFAR leaf logo in the header
- Logo appears in a white circle with shadow
- Added "Kifar Marketplace" subtitle
- Uses the official logo from `/images/logos/kfar_icon_leaf_green.png`

### 3. Enhanced Audio Management
- Centralized audio control in `useAudioQueue`
- Proper cleanup when closing the chat
- Better error handling for failed audio
- Continues processing queue even on errors

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created:
- `/hooks/useAudioQueue.ts` - Audio queue management

### Files Modified:
- `/components/voice/VoiceFirstChat.tsx` - Updated to use audio queue and added logo
- `/hooks/useVoiceCommerce.ts` - Updated to use audio queue
- `/config/voice-pronunciation.ts` - Phonetic pronunciation guide

## How It Works

1. **Audio Queue**: All voice responses are added to a queue
2. **Sequential Playback**: Only one audio plays at a time
3. **Interruption Handling**: When user speaks, all audio stops
4. **Error Recovery**: If audio fails, the queue continues

## Result

✅ No more overlapping voices
✅ Clean, professional logo in the header
✅ Better user experience with coherent voice responses
